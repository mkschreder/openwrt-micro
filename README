This is an adoptation of the buildroot/OpenWRT build system for bare metal
microcontroller development. 

Main goals of this project are: 

- faciliate code reuse through an automated build system that takes care of all
  aspects of the build enciroment
- provide a versatile build environment for cross compilation
- build all tools from source as part of the build environment to allow easy
  switching between various toolchains and libc implementations

Packaging

Software packages are created and maintained in the form of package feeds and
package Makefiles. A package makefile defines how the package is to be built
and where to get the source code. Most of the time build system will
automatically take care of running automake/cmake/make etc. 

Useful commands: 
	
	./scripts/feeds update -a
	./scripts/feeds install -a
	make menuconfig
	make V=s

More informaiton will come later as more targets and packages are added..

Target Selection
----------------

Targets are board configurations. Each board type can have a number of board
profiles. Currently profiles are not used but they can be used as a way to
select default options for other parts of the configuration. 

Target is configured using ARCH and BOARD parameters. ARCH determines the
toolchain to be used to build the code and board specifies the type of board.
Target directory name must currently be the same as the value of the BOARD
variable defined in the target Makefile. 

The final results of a build are placed in the bin directory that has
subdirectories that are named after board names together with libc version names.
