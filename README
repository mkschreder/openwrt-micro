This is an adoptation of the buildroot/OpenWRT build system for bare metal
microcontroller development. 

Main goals of this project are: 

- faciliate code reuse through an automated build system that takes care of all
  aspects of the build enciroment
- provide a versatile build environment for cross compilation
- build all tools from source as part of the build environment to allow easy
  switching between various toolchains and libc implementations

Packaging

Software packages are created and maintained in the form of package feeds and
package Makefiles. A package makefile defines how the package is to be built
and where to get the source code. Most of the time build system will
automatically take care of running automake/cmake/make etc. 

Useful commands: 
	
	make menuconfig
	make V=s

More informaiton will come later as more targets and packages are added..
